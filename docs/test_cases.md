**Test Case ID:** TC-01

**Title:** Successful Authentication with OAuth 2.0

**Preconditions:**

* A valid Jira instance with OAuth 2.0 enabled.
* Client ID and Client Secret for the LLM application.

**Test Steps:**

1. Configure the LLM to use OAuth 2.0 for authentication with Jira.
2. Provide the Client ID and Client Secret to the LLM.
3. Initiate the authentication process.

**Expected Results:**

* No error messages are displayed.

**Test Case ID:** TC-02

**Title:** Retrieving Issue Data with JQL Query

**Preconditions:**

* Successful authentication with Jira (TC-01).
* A valid JQL query to filter issues.

**Test Steps:**

1. Use the JQL query to retrieve issue data from Jira.
2. Specify the desired issue fields (e.g., Summary, Description, Assignee).

**Expected Results:**

* The LLM retrieves the requested issue data based on the JQL query and specified fields.
* The data is accurate and complete.

**Test Case ID:** TC-03

**Title:** Access Denied for Unauthorized User

**Preconditions:**

* Invalid or expired access token.

**Test Steps:**

1. Attempt to retrieve issue data with the invalid token.

**Expected Results:**

* The LLM receives an error message indicating access is denied.
* The attempt is logged and the reason for denial is documented.

**Test Case ID:** TC-04

**Title:** Error Handling for Malformed JQL Query

**Preconditions:**

* A malformed or invalid JQL query.

**Test Steps:**

1. Use the malformed JQL query to retrieve issue data.

**Expected Results:**

* The LLM displays a clear error message indicating the JQL query is invalid.
* The error message provides guidance on correcting the query.

**Test Case ID:** TC-05

**Title:** Data Transfer Security with HTTPS

**Preconditions:**

* Network traffic capture tool.

**Test Steps:**

1. Capture network traffic during LLM communication with Jira.
2. Analyze the captured traffic.

* No sensitive information like API tokens or passwords are transmitted in plain text.

**Test Case ID:** TC-06

**Title:** Performance Impact on Jira Instance

**Preconditions:**

* Monitoring tools for Jira performance metrics.

**Test Steps:**

1. Run a performance test with the LLM retrieving data from Jira.
2. Monitor CPU, memory, and response time metrics for the Jira instance.

**Expected Results:**

* The LLM retrieves data efficiently without significantly impacting Jira's performance.
* Response times remain within acceptable limits.

**Test Case ID:** TC-07

**Title:** Logging Sensitive Information

**Preconditions:**

* Review LLM logs.

**Test Steps:**

1. Analyze LLM logs for sensitive information like API tokens, passwords, or personally identifiable data.

**Expected Results:**

* LLM logs do not contain any sensitive information.
* Sensitive data is masked or redacted.

These test cases cover various aspects of LLM access to Jira data, ensuring proper authentication, data retrieval, security, and performance. They also address potential error scenarios and data protection measures.
