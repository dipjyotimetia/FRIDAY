### **Jira Story: Enable LLM to Read Data from Jira Issues**  
**Story ID:** (Assigned by Jira)  
**Story Type:** Feature  

#### **Description**  
As a user, I want the LLM to read data from Jira issues directly, so I can automate workflows and retrieve relevant information for reporting, analysis, and contextual decision-making. The feature should include robust authentication and data filtering to ensure that only authorized data is accessible.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

1. **Authentication:**  
   - The LLM must authenticate with Jira using OAuth 2.0, API tokens, or a secure method.  

2. **Data Retrieval:**  
   - The system should allow the LLM to retrieve issue fields such as **Summary**, **Description**, **Status**, **Priority**, **Assignee**, and **Comments**.  
   - Support for retrieving data based on JQL queries.  

3. **Permissions:**  
   - Ensure data access complies with Jira project and issue-level permissions.  
   - Unauthorized access attempts should be logged and denied.  

4. **Error Handling:**  
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid credentials, access denial, or malformed queries.  
   - Retry mechanisms for transient errors like timeouts.  

5. **Performance:**  
   - Fetch issue data efficiently without affecting Jira's performance.  

6. **Security:**  
   - All data transfer must use HTTPS.  
   - Logs should not include sensitive information like API tokens or passwords.
